# Widget Universe - Development Plan

## Architecture Overview

The Widget Universe application follows a vertical slice architecture approach where features are organized by domain rather than technical concern. This allows for better separation of concerns and makes it easier to maintain and extend the application.

## Project Structure

```

├── components/     # Shared UI components
├── core/           # Core application configuration and utilities
├── hooks/          # Shared React hooks
├── lib/            # Shared utility functions
├── pages/          # Top-level route components
├── shared/         # Shared business logic and utilities
└── slices/         # Feature slices
    ├── dashboard/  # Dashboard feature
    ├── devtools/   # Developer tools feature
    ├── documentation/ # Documentation feature
    ├── ecosystem/  # Ecosystem feature
    ├── error/      # Error handling feature
    └── home/       # Home page feature
```

## Feature Slices

Each feature slice follows a consistent structure:

```
slices/feature-name/
├── components/     # UI components specific to the feature
├── constants/      # Constants used by the feature
├── contexts/       # Context providers for the feature
├── hooks/          # React hooks specific to the feature
├── pages/          # Route components for the feature
├── services/       # Services for the feature
├── types/          # TypeScript types for the feature
└── utils/          # Utility functions for the feature
```

## Dashboard Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Create basic dashboard layout with sidebar and content area
2. ✅ Implement sidebar navigation using shadcn/ui components
3. ✅ Create dashboard content components
4. ✅ Add dashboard header component
5. ✅ Implement dynamic navigation with proper route handling
6. ☐ Add widgets grid to dashboard home
7. ☐ Create widget card components
8. ☐ Implement widget drag and drop functionality
9. ☐ Add widget settings and configuration

## Devtools Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Create devtools panel component
2. ✅ Implement devtools context for state management
3. ✅ Add logs panel for console logging
4. ✅ Add network panel for request monitoring
5. ✅ Add performance panel for monitoring performance metrics
6. ✅ Add state panel for inspecting application state
7. ✅ Add settings panel for configuring devtools

## API, Database, Authentication and RBAC

Currently, the application uses local storage for persistence to enable rapid development. In the future, we'll implement:

1. ☐ RESTful API integration with proper error handling
2. ☐ Database integration with proper data models
3. ☐ Authentication system with JWT
4. ☐ Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
5. ☐ API middleware for handling authentication and authorization

## Widget Store Implementation Plan

1. ☐ Create widget store page
2. ☐ Implement widget listing with categories
3. ☐ Add widget details page
4. ☐ Add widget installation functionality
5. ☐ Add widget ratings and reviews
6. ☐ Implement widget search and filtering

## Testing Plan

1. ☐ Set up unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
2. ☐ Add component tests for UI components
3. ☐ Add integration tests for feature slices
4. ☐ Add end-to-end tests with Cypress
5. ☐ Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions

## Deployment Plan

1. ☐ Set up Docker containerization
2. ☐ Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. ☐ Set up staging environment
4. ☐ Set up production environment
5. ☐ Implement monitoring and logging
