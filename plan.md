# Widget Integration Universe - Project Plan

## 1. Project Architecture

We've implemented a vertical slice architecture with:

- **shared/** - Cross-cutting concerns and reusable components
- **slices/** - Feature-specific modules organized by domain

## 3. Data Management

Currently, we're using local storage for data persistence. We've implemented API service skeletons to prepare for backend integration.

### Database Schema (Implemented in Types)

```
Widget {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  iconName: string
  category: string
  author: string
  version: string
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  dependencies: string[]
  config: Object
  permissions: string[]
}
UserPreference {
  id: string
  userId: string
  theme: string
  layout: string
  widgets: string[] (references Widget.id)
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

Dashboard {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  userId: string
  layout: Object
  widgets: Object[] (Widget configs)
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

DevToolsData {
  id: string
  userId: string
  type: string (logs, network, performance, state)
  data: Object
  timestamp: Date
  metadata: Object
}
```

## 5. Current Focus

Our current focus is completing the feature sections:

1. Implementing Dashboard pages for widget management and configuration
2. Creating a Widget Manager for better organization and discovery
3. Setting up widget data persistence and state management
4. Implementing cross-widget communication via an event bus
5. Building developer tools for debugging and monitoring

## 6. Development Guidelines

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Create small, focused components (<100 lines)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document all public APIs and components
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive designs for all views
- Extract constants to dedicated files for better maintainability
- Use string-based icon identifiers with the renderIcon utility for consistent icon handling
- Ensure proper type definitions across all components
- Use proper custom hooks for shared logic
- Maintain consistent styling with reusable CSS variables
- Centralize icon management with categorized icon systems
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI design
- Design services to work with both localStorage and future API integration
- Implement interfaces that abstract storage mechanisms for easy migration to actual backends

## 7. Preview & Development

To preview the project:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The development server will start at http://localhost:8080

## 8. Best Practices Implemented

- Properly typed components using TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Lazy loading for better performance
- File-based routing using React Router
- Error handling with fallbacks
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Context API for global state management
- DRY code with constants files for each slice
- Consistent icon handling across components with categorization
- Proper type inheritance and interface design
- Documentation organization with consistent section structure
- Centralized icon management with categorized icons for better organization and discoverability
- Dashboard layout with shadcn/ui sidebar components
- Vertical slice architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Service interfaces that abstract storage implementation details
- DevTools designed for easy migration from localStorage to backend APIs

## 9. Future Backend Integration

The current implementation uses localStorage for data persistence, but is designed to be easily migrated to a proper backend:

1. **Abstraction Layer**: We've implemented service classes that abstract the storage mechanism, making it easy to swap localStorage for API calls.

2. **Type Definitions**: All data models have proper TypeScript interfaces that reflect the expected database schema.

3. **Migration Path**: To migrate to a real backend:
   - Replace StorageService methods with API calls
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add proper error handling for network issues
   - Implement real-time updates with WebSockets where needed

4. **Authentication & RBAC**: The application is prepared for:
   - User authentication with JWT or similar token-based auth
   - Role-based access control with permission checking
   - User-specific data isolation

5. **API Service Structure**: We have placeholder API service files that will be expanded to include:
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - GraphQL integration (optional)
   - Proper error handling
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Caching strategies

Our current localStorage-based implementation serves as a functional prototype while collecting requirements for the final backend implementation
