# Workshop Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan for implementing workshop functionality in the dashboard sidebar. Workshops are structured learning paths for different user types (marketing, developer, dashboard) with progress tracking.

## Current Status
- ✅ Created basic workshop data structure and types
- ✅ Added workshop progress component
- ✅ Integrated workshops in the dashboard sidebar
- ✅ Added workshop service for data fetching
- ✅ Fixed type error in dashboard service

## Workshop Types
1. **Marketing Workshop** (0% complete)
   - For super dashboard users
   - Path: `/workshop/marketing`

2. **Developer Workshop** (80% complete)
   - Widget universe focused
   - Path: `/workshop/developer`

3. **Dashboard Workshop** (30% complete)
   - Dashboard customization and usage
   - Path: `/workshop/dashboard`

## Components Implemented
- `WorkshopProgress`: Displays workshop completion percentage with color coding
- `WorkshopsNav`: Workshop navigation in the dashboard sidebar

## Next Steps
1. **Workshop Content Development**
   - [ ] Create content structure for each workshop type
   - [ ] Implement workshop step tracking
   - [ ] Add workshop completion functionality

2. **Workshop Detail Pages**
   - [ ] Enhance the workshop detail page with proper layout
   - [ ] Add navigation between workshop steps
   - [ ] Implement progress saving functionality

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - [ ] Add animations for progress updates
   - [ ] Implement notifications for workshop completion
   - [ ] Add dashboard widgets showing workshop progress

4. **Admin Features**
   - [ ] Create workshop management interface
   - [ ] Add ability to assign workshops to users
   - [ ] Implement analytics for workshop engagement

## Technical Approach
We're following the slices architecture approach, organizing workshop-related features in their own slice:

```
src/slices/workshops/
├── components/       # Reusable workshop components
├── contexts/         # Workshop-specific contexts
├── data/            # Static workshop data
├── pages/           # Workshop pages (list and detail)
├── services/        # Workshop data services
├── types/           # TypeScript types for workshops
└── plan.md          # This planning document
```

## Integration Points
- Dashboard sidebar integration via `WorkshopsNav` component
- Shared progress indicator using shadcn/ui Progress component
- Routes in App.tsx for workshop list and detail pages

## Expected Results
Users will see workshop options in the sidebar with clear visual indication of their progress. They can navigate to specific workshops and continue their learning journey.
